The song was a response to Jay-Z\'s \"Takeover\", a diss track directed towards Nas and Prodigy which appears on Jay-Z\'s album The Blueprint, during the Jay-Z vs. Nas and Prodigy feud. Nas named the song Ether because \"I was told along time ago,ghosts and spirits don't like the fumes from ether, and I just wanted to affect him with my weapon and get to his soul\".","date_added" : new Date(),"event_date" : new Date(2001,12,18),"highlights" : {"top_lyrics" : {"0" : "I got this, locked since Nine-One (1991), I am the truest/ Name a rapper that I ain't influenced.","1" : "Then you got the nerve to say that you're better than Big/ Dick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live"}},"loc_img_link" : "nas.jpg","youtube_link" : "https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ePQKD9iBfU","spotify_link" : "https://play.spotify.com/album/0cLzuJG2UDa0axMQkF7JR6","genius_link" : "https://genius.com/Nas-ether-lyrics","wikipedia_link" : "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether_(song)","data_sources" : {"1" : "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether_(song)"},"to_string" : "Ether"})
