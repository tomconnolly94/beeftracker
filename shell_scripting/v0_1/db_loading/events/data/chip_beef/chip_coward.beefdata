Coward
Chip
Tinie Tempah|Bugzy Malone
This is Chip’s response to Tinies 'Been the Man', which questions Tinie’s ability to release a diss track without the help of a more credible, underground grime MC. The song uses the beat from Ruff Sqwad and Wiley’s classic track 'Together', produced by Ruff Sqwad member Dirty Danger.
