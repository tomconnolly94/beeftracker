96 Bars of Revenge
Chip
Bugzy Malone|Tinie Tempah|Yungen
Chip seems to overload and just stop giving a f**k on this track. He is swinging high and low looking for a response to this destructive yet though provoking track.

How the fuck has he done more for grime than me this year? I opened up the scene this year, gave birth to this ediat brare| Where's the guy that made Oopsy Daisy, not here right now you can get some more|He came to my house for dinner before his fire in the booth and you wonder why I can't stand him|If your'e gonna nominate Yungen... Big up, but nominate Sneakbo too
