Nas released this on his 'Stillmatic' album, it was the warning sign intended to be the pretext to Ether. Reminding the audience why they crowned him the greatest and brushing off any attempts by others to claim that title.

Top Lyrics#My first album had no famous guest appearances, The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist#Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine#You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death, Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos, Call me 'God's Son' with my pants low, I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
