Top Lyrics#Niggasll tie you up on the Colosseum roof, And open beer bottles off the boy chipped tooth...|Me and the boy AI got more in common than just balling and rhyming, Get it? More in Carmen|And since you infatuated with saying that gay shit Yes you was kissing my dick when you was kissing that bitch
