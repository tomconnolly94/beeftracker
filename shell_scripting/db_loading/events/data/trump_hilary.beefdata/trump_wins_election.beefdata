Donald Trump wins the Presidential Election
Donald Trump
Hillary Clinton
Donald Trump has run a successful campaign to become the 45th President of the US. He ran a controversial and aggressive campaign but clearly his words spoke to many millions of americans who voted for him. Interestingly he won the electoral college vote and lost the majority vote by around 3 million. This election is not a clear mandate and possibly represents clever campaign tactics to target swing states coupled with poor campaign tactics of Ms Clinton to focus to much on her base of support. It also raises some serious questions about the electoral college systems

Look, we’ve got to beat China in trade. We’ve got to beat Isis. We’ve got so many problems in this country| I say she does not have the stamina to be a good president ... doesn’t have the energy, she doesn’t have it. Doesn’t have the strength to be president, in my opinion
